My approach is to build the application in layers, starting with the core logic and expanding outwards. This ensures that each component is solid before you build the next one on top of it. This incremental approach is easier to debug and manage than trying to build everything at once.

### High-Level Strategy & Architectural Choices

Hereâ€™s the plan I would recommend and the reasoning behind it.

1.  **Foundation First (Project Setup & Models):** Start with a clean project structure. This will save you a lot of headaches later.
2.  **Isolate the Core Game Logic:** Build the entire crash game state machine and round progression _without_ WebSockets or real crypto prices first. This lets you perfect the most complex part of the application in a controlled environment.
3.  **Layer on Cryptocurrency Integration:** Once the game works with dummy values, integrate the live cryptocurrency API. This separates the game logic from the external data-fetching logic.
4.  **Introduce the Real-Time Layer (WebSockets):** With a functioning game backend, add the WebSocket layer to broadcast state to the clients. This is the final step, connecting your solid backend to the outside world in real-time.

#### Why This Plan is Effective:

- **Reduces Complexity:** By tackling one major component at a time (Game Logic -\> Crypto -\> WebSockets), you can focus your attention and make debugging significantly easier.
- **Promotes Strong Architecture:** It naturally leads to a modular design where your game service, crypto service, and WebSocket handlers are separate concerns. This is highly valued in professional development.
- [cite\_start]**Aligns with Evaluation Criteria:** It allows you to dedicate focused effort to the highest-weighted parts of the assignment first: Game Logic (35%) and Crypto Integration (35%)[cite: 99, 105].

### Phase 1: The Blueprint (Project Setup & Database Models)

**Goal:** Create a solid foundation for the rest of your project.

1.  **Initialize Your Project:**
    - Set up your Node.js project (`npm init`).
    - [cite\_start]Install the necessary dependencies: `express`, `mongoose` (for MongoDB), `axios` (for API calls), `crypto` (built-in, for the provably fair algorithm), and `socket.io` (I recommend this over `ws` for its simplicity, auto-reconnection, and room management features which are perfect for this game)[cite: 69, 71, 73].
2.  **Establish a Clear Folder Structure:** A clean structure is a sign of a professional developer.
    ```
    /src
    |-- /api
    |   |-- routes.js         // Express routes
    |   |-- controller.js     // Route handlers
    |-- /models
    |   |-- player.js         // Player schema (wallet)
    |   |-- gameRound.js      // Game history schema
    |   |-- transaction.js    // Transaction log schema
    |-- /services
    |   |-- gameService.js    // The core game loop and logic
    |   |-- cryptoService.js    // Handles crypto API calls and caching
    |   |-- socketService.js    // Manages WebSocket connections and events
    |-- /config
    |   |-- db.js             // MongoDB connection
    |   |-- index.js          // Environment variables
    |-- server.js             // Entry point: sets up Express & Socket.IO
    ```
3.  **Define Your Database Schemas (Mongoose):**
    - **Player:** Should include fields like `username`, and a `wallet` object to store balances for different cryptocurrencies (e.g., `{ BTC: 0.1, ETH: 2.5 }`).
    - **GameRound:** This is for history. [cite\_start]Include `roundId`, the `crashPoint`, the `serverSeed` and `hash` (for provable fairness), and an array of `bets` containing player info, bet amount, and cashout multiplier[cite: 31].
    - [cite\_start]**Transaction:** This will log every financial action[cite: 54]. [cite\_start]Fields should include `playerId`, `usdAmount`, `cryptoAmount`, `currency`, `transactionType` ('bet' or 'cashout'), a `mockTransactionHash`, the `priceAtTime`, and a `timestamp`[cite: 54].

### Phase 2: The Core Game Engine

**Goal:** Implement the game's state machine and logic. At this stage, you can use hardcoded values for crypto prices.

1.  **The Game Service (`gameService.js`):** This will be the heart of your application. Create a singleton or a class that manages the game state. The state can cycle through:
    - `WAITING`: A brief period between rounds.
    - [cite\_start]`BETTING`: The 10-second window where players can place bets[cite: 14].
    - `IN_PROGRESS`: The multiplier is actively increasing.
    - `CRASHED`: The game has ended, and results are being processed.
2.  **The Game Loop:** Use `setInterval` to drive the game's progression every second.
    - [cite\_start]A main 10-second timer will control the start of each round[cite: 14].
    - [cite\_start]During the `IN_PROGRESS` state, use another faster timer (e.g., `setInterval(..., 100)`) to update the multiplier[cite: 62].
3.  [cite\_start]**Implement the Provably Fair Algorithm:** This is a critical feature[cite: 17, 26].
    - **On round start:**
      1.  Generate a secret `serverSeed` using `crypto.randomBytes()`.
      2.  Create a public `hash` using `crypto.createHash('sha256').update(serverSeed).digest('hex')`. You'll show this hash to players _before_ the round starts.
      3.  Combine the `serverSeed` and the `roundNumber` (or another public value) to generate the crash point. A robust way to do this is using HMAC: `crypto.createHmac('sha256', serverSeed).update(roundNumber.toString()).digest('hex')`.
      4.  Convert this hex value to a number to determine the crash point. **Crucially, don't just use modulo.** This creates an unfair distribution. A better method is to take the first \~5 characters of the hash, convert to a number, and use a formula to map it to an exponential distribution, making high multipliers much rarer than low ones. This detail shows advanced understanding.
    - **On round end:** Reveal the `serverSeed` so players can verify that hashing it produces the pre-round hash and that the crash point was determined fairly.
4.  **Create Placeholder API Endpoints (`routes.js` & `controller.js`):**
    - [cite\_start]`POST /api/bet`: Takes `userId`, `usdAmount`, and `crypto` (e.g., 'BTC')[cite: 24]. For now, just log the bet.
    - [cite\_start]`POST /api/cashout`: Takes `userId`[cite: 25]. For now, just log the request.

### Phase 3: Cryptocurrency and Wallet Integration

**Goal:** Connect your game to the real world by fetching live prices and managing player wallets.

1.  **The Crypto Service (`cryptoService.js`):**
    - [cite\_start]**Fetch Prices:** Create a function `getPrices()` that uses `axios` to call a free crypto API like CoinGecko[cite: 35].
    - [cite\_start]**Implement Caching:** The assignment requires 10-second caching[cite: 50]. Create a simple in-memory cache:
      ```javascript
      let priceCache = {
        BTC: { price: 0, lastFetch: 0 },
        ETH: { price: 0, lastFetch: 0 },
      };
      // Before fetching, check if (Date.now() - lastFetch < 10000)
      ```
    - **Handle Errors:** If the API call fails, use the last cached price and log the error. [cite\_start]This demonstrates graceful error handling[cite: 83].
2.  **Update the Betting Logic:**
    - Modify the `POST /api/bet` controller.
    - When a bet is placed, call `cryptoService.getPrices()` to get the current price.
    - [cite\_start]Calculate the crypto amount (`usdAmount / price`)[cite: 52].
    - [cite\_start]**Implement Atomic Transactions:** This is essential to prevent race conditions[cite: 56]. Use MongoDB's session transactions (`session.withTransaction(...)`) to perform these two actions as one atomic unit:
      1.  Deduct the `cryptoAmount` from the player's wallet in the `players` collection.
      2.  Create a new record in the `transactions` collection.
          If either step fails, the entire operation rolls back. This is a very strong and "elegant" solution.
3.  **Update the Cashout Logic:**
    - In your `gameService`, when a player cashes out, calculate the winnings in crypto (`betAmountInCrypto * currentMultiplier`).
    - Use another atomic transaction to add the winnings to their wallet and log the 'cashout' transaction.

### Phase 4: The Real-Time Multiplayer Layer

**Goal:** Use WebSockets to create a live, shared experience for all players.

1.  **The Socket Service (`socketService.js`):**
    - Initialize Socket.IO and attach it to your Express server.
    - This service will be called by your `gameService` to broadcast events to all connected clients.
2.  **Emit Game State Events:**
    - [cite\_start]In your `gameService` loop, emit events at each state change[cite: 59]:
      - [cite\_start]`round:start` -\> Send the `roundId` and the public `hash`[cite: 61].
      - [cite\_start]`multiplier:update` -\> Send the new multiplier value every 100ms[cite: 62].
      - [cite\_start]`player:cashed_out` -\> When a player successfully cashes out, broadcast their `userId` and `payout` so everyone can see it[cite: 63].
      - [cite\_start]`round:crash` -\> Send the final `crashPoint` and the revealed `serverSeed`[cite: 64].
3.  **Handle Cashouts via WebSockets:**
    - [cite\_start]Instead of a REST API endpoint for cashouts, use WebSockets for lower latency, as suggested by the assignment[cite: 66].
    - Create a listener on your server: `socket.on('cashout:request', () => { ... })`.
    - When this event is received, trigger the cashout logic in your `gameService` for that player.
    - [cite\_start]**Security:** Ensure you validate that the player has an active bet and hasn't already cashed out before processing the request[cite: 81].

### Phase 5: Documentation & Deliverables

**Goal:** Polish your project and prepare it for submission. This is the final 10% but makes a huge difference in perception.

1.  **README.md:** This is your project's front page. [cite\_start]Be thorough[cite: 94].
    - [cite\_start]**Setup:** Clear, step-by-step instructions on how to install dependencies and run the project[cite: 86].
    - [cite\_start]**API Documentation:** Detail your endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/bet`) with request/response examples[cite: 87].
    - [cite\_start]**WebSocket Events:** List all server-emitted events (`round:start`, etc.) and client-sent events (`cashout:request`) with their payloads[cite: 88].
    - [cite\_start]**Provably Fair Explanation:** Clearly explain how your algorithm works, how a player can verify a round's result, and why it's fair[cite: 89]. This shows you didn't just copy code.
2.  **Testing Scripts:**
    - [cite\_start]**Data Seeding:** Create a simple script (`node seed.js`) to populate the database with a few players and wallets[cite: 95].
    - **Postman Collection:** Create and export a Postman collection for your API endpoints. [cite\_start]This makes testing your work effortless for the reviewer[cite: 96].
    - **Basic WebSocket Client:** A simple HTML file with JavaScript that connects to your server, listens for events, and has a "Cash Out" button. [cite\_start]This is required to demonstrate the full functionality[cite: 97].

By following this phased approach, you'll build a complex application in a manageable way, resulting in a well-structured and impressive project that directly addresses all the requirements and evaluation criteria. Good luck\!
